# Pacman app
This is a project I have been wanting to work on for a while now mainly because I want to implement a pathfinding algorithm (TBD) 

## Project Goals
My main goal here is to get more experience on code design and specification (method/class specs as well as this readme) outside the confines of school work as well as have some fun over break

### TODOS
* Working pacman simulator
* Graphics improvement 
* Level designer
* AI / pathfinding
* Play as ghosts

## Journal
__(12/20/20)__ Today's goal was mainly to brainstorm how I want to structure this project. I decided to use Python rather than Java because I have some previous experience with _pygame_ and my lone experience with GUIs in Java involved JSwing which was atrocious.
I am able to produce a blank window so I at least know everything is installed correctly. I am also thinking of separating components like buttons, tiles, etc into their own directory similar to projects done in React.
